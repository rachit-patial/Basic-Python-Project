madtext = f"Today I went to my favorite Taco Stand called the {madlibs[0]} {madlibs[8]}. Unlike most food stands, they cook and prepare the food in a {madlibs[7]} while you sleep. The best thing on the menu is the {madlibs[6]} {madlibs[4]}. Instead of ground beef they fill the taco with {madlibs[5]}, cheese, and top it off with a salsa made from {madlibs[2]}. If that doesn't make your mouth water, then it's just like {madlibs[9]} always says: {madlibs[3]}"
